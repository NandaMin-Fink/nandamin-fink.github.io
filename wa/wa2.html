        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Nanda Min-Fink, I am 20 years old and a student at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am in my junior year, pursuing a major in Computer Science and a Minor in <abbr title="Creative Technology and Design">CTD</abbr>. My goals for the class are to improve my fundamental understanding of web design and get more experience programming. I am currently interning at a software programming company in Niwot working on back-end databases and authentication systems.

            Outside of school I spend a lot of my time hiking, snowboarding, and playing Ultimate Frisbee. Overall, <em>I love the outdoors and try to get out as much as possible regardless of the activity</em>.
